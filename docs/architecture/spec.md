## 1. Database Schema Analysis and Compatibility

### 1.1. Retrorecon Database Schema Overview

The `retrorecon` project utilizes a SQLite database with several tables to store reconnaissance data. The schema, as provided in `db/schema.sql`, includes tables for `urls`, `jobs`, `import_status`, `notes`, `text_notes`, `jwt_cookies`, `screenshots`, `sitezips`, `assets`, and `domains`. For the purpose of this new application, the `domains` table is of particular interest due to its direct relevance to the DNS enumeration feature.

### 1.2. Analysis of the `domains` Table

The `domains` table in `retrorecon` is defined as follows:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS domains (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    root_domain TEXT NOT NULL,
    subdomain TEXT NOT NULL,
    source TEXT NOT NULL,
    tags TEXT DEFAULT \'\',
    cdx_indexed INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    fetched_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    UNIQUE(subdomain, source)
);
```

This schema captures essential information for subdomain enumeration, including the `root_domain`, `subdomain`, and the `source` from which the subdomain was discovered (e.g., `crt.sh`, `virustotal.org`, `shodan.io`). The `tags` field allows for categorization, and `cdx_indexed` and `fetched_at` provide metadata about the data's origin and freshness. The `UNIQUE(subdomain, source)` constraint ensures that duplicate entries from the same source are not added.

### 1.3. Compatibility with User Requirements

#### 1.3.1. Spreadsheet-like Interface and Collapsible Rows

The existing `domains` table structure is well-suited for populating a spreadsheet-like interface. The `root_domain` and `subdomain` fields directly support the hierarchical display requested by the user:

```
- example.com
---- www.example.com
---- ---- stage.www.example.com
---- ---- dev.www.example.com
---- mail.example.com
```

To achieve the collapsible row functionality, the frontend application will need to process the `root_domain` and `subdomain` fields to construct a tree-like data structure. This can be done by parsing the `subdomain` field to identify sub-levels (e.g., `www.example.com` is a subdomain of `example.com`, and `stage.www.example.com` is a subdomain of `www.example.com`). The `id` field can serve as a unique identifier for each row, and the `tags` field can be used for filtering, sorting, labeling, and commenting, as requested by the user. Additional columns for user comments or labels can be added to the database schema if needed, or managed purely on the frontend.

#### 1.3.2. SQLite to PostgreSQL Transition

The `retrorecon` schema uses SQLite-specific syntax (e.g., `AUTOINCREMENT`). While the core table and column definitions are largely compatible, a direct migration to PostgreSQL will require minor adjustments. PostgreSQL uses `SERIAL` or `BIGSERIAL` for auto-incrementing primary keys, and `TEXT` types are generally compatible. The `TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` is also compatible. The `UNIQUE(subdomain, source)` constraint will also translate directly. Therefore, the transition from SQLite to PostgreSQL for this schema is straightforward and will primarily involve updating the data type for the `id` column and potentially adjusting any specific SQLite pragmas or functions if they were used in the original application's logic (which is not apparent from the schema alone).

#### 1.3.3. API Compatibility

The user expressed interest in reusing APIs from `retrorecon`. Given that `retrorecon` is a Python Flask application, its APIs would likely be RESTful endpoints. To ensure compatibility, the new React frontend will need to consume these APIs. The data returned by these APIs, particularly for subdomain enumeration, should align with the `domains` table structure. If the existing `retrorecon` APIs do not directly provide the normalized and deduplicated data in the desired format, a new backend service (or modifications to the existing `retrorecon` backend if it were to be reused) would be necessary to transform the data before sending it to the frontend. This new backend service would also handle the integration with `crt.sh`, `virustotal.org`, and `shodan.io` APIs, normalizing their outputs into the `domains` table format.

### 1.4. Recommendations for Subdomain Enumeration Services

In addition to `crt.sh`, `virustotal.org`, and `shodan.io`, other valuable services for subdomain enumeration include:

*   **Subfinder**: A passive subdomain enumeration tool that uses various sources.
*   **Amass**: A comprehensive attack surface mapping tool that includes subdomain enumeration.
*   **AssetFinder**: A tool to find domains and subdomains related to a given domain.
*   **DNSDumpster**: A web-based tool for DNS reconnaissance.

Integrating these services would further enhance the completeness of the subdomain enumeration. The backend service would be responsible for making API calls to these services, processing their responses, and inserting the unique subdomains into the `domains` table.




## 2. System Architecture and Technical Specifications

### 2.1. High-Level Architecture Overview

The proposed bug bounty reconnaissance application follows a modern three-tier architecture consisting of a React frontend, a Flask backend, and a database layer that starts with SQLite and migrates to PostgreSQL. The system is designed to be single-user and LAN-hosted for privacy, with integration to OpenAI-compatible LLM services through the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

The architecture can be visualized as follows:

```

```

### 2.2. Frontend Architecture

#### 2.2.1. React Application Structure

The React frontend will be built using Create React App with TypeScript for type safety and better development experience. The application will utilize a component-based architecture with the following key components:

**Main Layout Component**: This component will manage the split viewport layout, with the LLM chat interface on one side and the reconnaissance dashboard on the other. The layout will be responsive and allow users to resize the panels according to their preferences.

**Chat Interface Component**: This component will handle communication with the LLM through the backend API. It will maintain conversation history, support markdown rendering for LLM responses, and provide a clean, modern chat interface similar to those found in FANG company products.

**Reconnaissance Dashboard Component**: This is the core component that displays the spreadsheet-like interface for domain enumeration results. It will support collapsible rows, filtering, sorting, and inline editing for tags and comments.

**Domain Tree Component**: A specialized component for rendering the hierarchical domain structure with collapsible rows. This component will handle the tree-like data structure and provide intuitive expand/collapse functionality.

**API Integration Layer**: A service layer that handles all communication with the backend API, including domain enumeration requests, LLM chat messages, and data persistence operations.

#### 2.2.2. State Management

The application will use React Context API combined with useReducer hooks for state management. This approach provides a centralized state management solution without the complexity of external libraries like Redux. The state will be organized into several contexts:

**Domain Context**: Manages the state of domain enumeration data, including the tree structure, filtering options, and sorting preferences.

**Chat Context**: Handles the LLM conversation state, including message history and current conversation status.

**UI Context**: Manages UI-specific state such as panel sizes, theme preferences, and modal states.

#### 2.2.3. Styling and UI Framework

The application will use Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling, combined with Headless UI components for accessible, unstyled UI primitives. This combination allows for rapid development while maintaining design consistency and accessibility standards. The design will follow modern FANG-style principles with clean lines, subtle shadows, and a professional color palette.

### 2.3. Backend Architecture

#### 2.3.1. Flask Application Structure

The Flask backend will be organized using the Application Factory pattern with blueprints for different functional areas:

**Main Application Factory**: Initializes the Flask app, configures database connections, and registers blueprints.

**Domain Blueprint**: Handles all domain-related API endpoints, including enumeration requests, data retrieval, and CRUD operations.

**Chat Blueprint**: Manages LLM communication, including message routing and response handling.

**MCP Blueprint**: Handles Model Context Protocol integration for LLM database access.

**External API Blueprint**: Manages integration with external services like crt.sh, VirusTotal, and Shodan.

#### 2.3.2. Database Integration

The backend will use SQLAlchemy as the ORM for database operations, providing an abstraction layer that supports both SQLite and PostgreSQL. The database models will be designed to match the retrorecon schema while allowing for future extensions.

**Domain Model**: Represents the domains table with additional methods for tree structure generation and filtering.

**Job Model**: Tracks background enumeration jobs and their status.

**Note Model**: Handles user annotations and comments on domains.

**Configuration Model**: Stores application settings and API keys.

#### 2.3.3. Background Task Processing

The application will use Celery with Redis as the message broker for handling background tasks such as domain enumeration. This allows the UI to remain responsive while long-running enumeration tasks execute in the background.

**Enumeration Tasks**: Background tasks that query external APIs and process results.

**Data Processing Tasks**: Tasks that normalize and deduplicate enumeration results.

**Notification Tasks**: Tasks that update the frontend about job completion status.

### 2.4. LLM Integration Architecture

#### 2.4.1. Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration

The application will implement MCP to allow the LLM to access the database and make API calls. This integration will be handled through a dedicated MCP server that runs alongside the main Flask application.

**Database Access**: The MCP server will provide tools for the LLM to query the domains database, allowing it to answer questions about discovered subdomains and their properties.

**API Access**: The MCP server will expose tools for making external API calls, enabling the LLM to fetch additional information about domains when requested.

**Wikipedia Integration**: A specific tool will be provided for fetching Wikipedia summaries of target organizations or domains.

#### 2.4.2. OpenAI-Compatible API Integration

The backend will include a client for communicating with OpenAI-compatible APIs. This client will handle authentication, request formatting, and response processing.

**Chat Completion Endpoint**: Handles standard chat interactions with the LLM.

**Function Calling**: Supports function calling for MCP tool invocation.

**Streaming Responses**: Provides real-time response streaming for better user experience.

### 2.5. External API Integration

#### 2.5.1. Certificate Transparency (crt.sh)

The application will integrate with crt.sh's JSON API to discover subdomains through certificate transparency logs. The integration will handle rate limiting and response parsing.

```python
async def query_crt_sh(domain: str) -> List[str]:
    """Query crt.sh for subdomains of the given domain."""
    url = f"https://crt.sh/?q=%.{domain}&output=json"
    # Implementation details...
```

#### 2.5.2. VirusTotal API

Integration with VirusTotal's API will require API key management and proper rate limiting to comply with their usage policies.

```python
async def query_virustotal(domain: str, api_key: str) -> List[str]:
    """Query VirusTotal for subdomains of the given domain."""
    url = f"https://www.virustotal.com/vtapi/v2/domain/report"
    # Implementation details...
```

#### 2.5.3. Shodan API

Shodan integration will focus on discovering subdomains through their search API, with proper handling of search credits and rate limits.

```python
async def query_shodan(domain: str, api_key: str) -> List[str]:
    """Query Shodan for subdomains of the given domain."""
    url = f"https://api.shodan.io/shodan/host/search"
    # Implementation details...
```

### 2.6. Security Considerations

#### 2.6.1. API Key Management

All external API keys will be stored securely using environment variables or a dedicated configuration file that is not committed to version control. The application will provide a settings interface for users to configure their API keys.

#### 2.6.2. Input Validation

All user inputs will be validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks. Domain names will be validated using regular expressions and DNS resolution checks.

#### 2.6.3. Rate Limiting

The application will implement rate limiting for external API calls to prevent abuse and comply with service provider policies.

### 2.7. Performance Considerations

#### 2.7.1. Database Optimization

Database queries will be optimized using appropriate indexes, and the application will implement pagination for large result sets. The existing retrorecon indexes will be maintained and additional indexes will be added as needed.

#### 2.7.2. Caching

The application will implement caching for frequently accessed data, including enumeration results and LLM responses. Redis will be used as the caching layer.

#### 2.7.3. Asynchronous Processing

All external API calls will be handled asynchronously to prevent blocking the main application thread. The frontend will provide real-time updates on enumeration progress.



## 3. UI/UX Specifications and Design Guidelines

### 3.1. Design Philosophy and FANG-Style Principles

The user interface design for this bug bounty reconnaissance application will follow the design principles commonly found in FANG (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google) company products. These principles emphasize clean, modern aesthetics with a focus on functionality, accessibility, and user experience. The design will prioritize information density while maintaining visual clarity, ensuring that security researchers can efficiently process large amounts of data without cognitive overload.

The core design philosophy centers around three fundamental principles: **Clarity**, **Efficiency**, and **Elegance**. Clarity ensures that all interface elements serve a clear purpose and are immediately understandable to users. Efficiency focuses on minimizing the number of actions required to complete common tasks, particularly in the context of domain enumeration and analysis. Elegance refers to the visual refinement and attention to detail that creates a professional, trustworthy appearance suitable for security research work.

The color palette will draw inspiration from modern security tools and professional development environments, utilizing a dark theme as the primary interface with light theme options available. The dark theme reduces eye strain during extended research sessions and provides better contrast for highlighting important information such as newly discovered subdomains or security-relevant findings.

### 3.2. Layout Architecture and Viewport Management

#### 3.2.1. Split Viewport Design

The application's main interface will feature a sophisticated split viewport design that allows users to simultaneously interact with the LLM chat interface and perform reconnaissance tasks. This dual-pane approach maximizes screen real estate utilization while maintaining context between AI assistance and active research work.

The primary viewport will be divided into two main sections with a resizable splitter between them. The left panel will house the LLM chat interface, occupying approximately 30-40% of the screen width by default. The right panel will contain the main reconnaissance dashboard, taking up the remaining 60-70% of the screen width. Users will be able to adjust this ratio by dragging the splitter, with the application remembering their preferred layout configuration.

A collapsible sidebar will be positioned on the far left of the interface, containing navigation elements, quick actions, and system status indicators. This sidebar can be minimized to a narrow icon bar to maximize space for the main content areas when needed. The top of the interface will feature a clean header bar containing the application logo, global search functionality, user settings access, and system status indicators.

#### 3.2.2. Responsive Design Considerations

While the application is primarily designed for desktop use in a LAN environment, the interface will incorporate responsive design principles to ensure usability across different screen sizes and resolutions. On smaller screens or when the application window is resized, the split viewport will automatically adjust to a stacked layout, with the chat interface moving to a modal or drawer-style overlay that can be toggled on demand.

The reconnaissance dashboard will maintain its functionality across different screen sizes through adaptive column management, where less critical columns can be hidden or moved to expandable detail views on smaller displays. Touch-friendly interaction patterns will be incorporated to support hybrid devices and touch-enabled monitors.

### 3.3. LLM Chat Interface Design

#### 3.3.1. Conversation Layout and Message Rendering

The LLM chat interface will feature a modern conversation layout similar to those found in professional AI tools like ChatGPT or Claude. Messages will be displayed in a clean, chronological format with clear visual distinction between user messages and AI responses. User messages will appear in a subtle background color aligned to the right side of the chat panel, while AI responses will use a different background color and align to the left.

Each message will include a timestamp, and AI responses will feature a typing indicator animation during generation to provide feedback about processing status. The interface will support rich text rendering for AI responses, including markdown formatting, code syntax highlighting, and inline links. When the AI references specific domains or subdomains from the database, these will be rendered as interactive elements that can highlight corresponding entries in the main dashboard.

The chat input area will feature a sophisticated text input field with support for multi-line messages, auto-completion for common queries, and quick action buttons for frequently used commands. A message history feature will allow users to navigate through previous conversations and re-submit modified versions of earlier queries.

#### 3.3.2. Context Awareness and Integration

The chat interface will display contextual information about the current reconnaissance session, including the number of domains being analyzed, active enumeration jobs, and recent discoveries. This context panel will be collapsible and positioned above the message history, providing the AI with relevant information about the current research state.

Integration with the main dashboard will be seamless, with the ability to reference specific domains or subdomains in chat messages and have them automatically highlighted in the reconnaissance interface. Users will be able to drag and drop domains from the main dashboard into the chat interface to quickly ask questions about specific targets.

### 3.4. Reconnaissance Dashboard Design

#### 3.4.1. Spreadsheet-Style Interface

The main reconnaissance dashboard will implement a sophisticated spreadsheet-style interface that combines the familiarity of tools like Google Sheets with specialized functionality for security research. The interface will feature a hierarchical tree structure for displaying domain relationships, with collapsible rows that allow users to navigate complex subdomain hierarchies efficiently.

The primary table will include columns for domain name, source of discovery, discovery date, status indicators, tags, and user comments. Additional columns can be shown or hidden based on user preferences, including technical details like IP addresses, SSL certificate information, and HTTP response codes when available. The table will support both single and multi-row selection, enabling batch operations on multiple domains simultaneously.

Column headers will be interactive, providing sorting functionality and filter options. The sorting will be intelligent, understanding domain hierarchy and maintaining parent-child relationships even when sorted by other criteria. Filter options will include text-based filtering, tag-based filtering, and advanced filters based on discovery source, date ranges, and status indicators.

#### 3.4.2. Hierarchical Domain Display

The hierarchical domain display represents one of the most critical aspects of the user interface, as it directly addresses the user's requirement for organizing subdomains in a tree-like structure. Each domain level will be visually indented and connected with subtle lines to show the relationship hierarchy. Chevron icons will indicate expandable/collapsible sections, with smooth animations for expand and collapse operations.

The hierarchy will be constructed by parsing the subdomain structure, with the root domain at the top level and each subdomain level creating a new tier in the tree. For example, `stage.www.example.com` would appear under `www.example.com`, which would appear under `example.com`. The interface will handle complex subdomain structures gracefully, including cases where intermediate levels might not be explicitly discovered.

Visual indicators will distinguish between different types of entries: confirmed active domains, discovered but unverified subdomains, and domains with specific security relevance. Color coding and iconography will provide quick visual cues about the status and importance of each entry.

#### 3.4.3. Interactive Features and Bulk Operations

The reconnaissance dashboard will support a comprehensive set of interactive features designed to streamline the security research workflow. Right-click context menus will provide quick access to common operations such as adding tags, copying domain names, initiating new enumeration jobs, and opening domains in external tools.

Bulk operations will be supported through checkbox selection, allowing users to perform actions on multiple domains simultaneously. These operations will include bulk tagging, bulk export, batch verification, and bulk deletion. A floating action toolbar will appear when multiple items are selected, providing easy access to bulk operation options.

Inline editing will be supported for user-modifiable fields such as tags and comments. Double-clicking on these fields will enable edit mode with auto-save functionality. The interface will provide visual feedback for all user actions, including subtle animations for row updates and clear indicators for background processing status.

### 3.5. Navigation and Information Architecture

#### 3.5.1. Primary Navigation Structure

The application's navigation structure will be designed to support the workflow of security researchers, with primary navigation elements organized around core functional areas. The main navigation will include sections for Dashboard (the primary reconnaissance interface), Jobs (background enumeration task management), Settings (configuration and API key management), and Help (documentation and tutorials).

Secondary navigation will be contextual, appearing within each main section to provide access to related functionality. For example, within the Dashboard section, secondary navigation might include options for different view modes (tree view, flat list, timeline view), export options, and filter presets.
