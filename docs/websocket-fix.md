# WebSocket Configuration Fix

## Problem
The application was showing a black screen after authentication due to websocket connection failures when accessed from external browsers (outside Docker network).

## Root Cause
The frontend websocket service was attempting to connect directly to `ws://backend:5000`, which is a Docker internal hostname that only works within the Docker network.

## Solution
Updated the websocket URL resolution in `frontend/src/services/websocket.ts` to use smart environment detection:

### Development Mode
- **Before**: Used `VITE_API_URL` directly → `ws://backend:5000` (fails externally)  
- **After**: Uses `window.location.origin` → `ws://localhost:3000` (works via vite proxy)

### Production Mode  
- Uses `window.location.origin` → nginx proxies `/socket.io/` to `backend:5000` internally

## Configuration Details

### Vite Development Proxy
The vite config (`frontend/vite.config.ts`) already includes websocket proxy support:
```typescript
'/socket.io': {
  target: process.env.VITE_API_URL || 'http://localhost:5001',
  changeOrigin: true,
  ws: true,
}
```

### Nginx Production Proxy
The nginx config (`frontend/nginx.conf`) already includes websocket proxy support:
```nginx
location /socket.io/ {
    proxy_pass http://backend:5000;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
}
```

## Testing
- Added comprehensive test coverage in `frontend/src/services/websocket.test.ts`
- Verified all scenarios work correctly for both internal and external access
- All existing tests continue to pass

## Impact
- ✅ WebSocket connections now work from external browsers
- ✅ No more black screen after authentication  
- ✅ Real-time features (job updates, domain discovery, chat) work properly
- ✅ Both development and production deployments supported
