# General Specification for a Bug Bounty Reconnaissance Application

## 1. Database Schema Analysis and Compatibility

### 1.1. Retrorecon Database Schema Overview

The `retrorecon` project utilizes a SQLite database with several tables to store reconnaissance data. The schema, as provided in `db/schema.sql`, includes tables for `urls`, `jobs`, `import_status`, `notes`, `text_notes`, `jwt_cookies`, `screenshots`, `sitezips`, `assets`, and `domains`. For the purpose of this new application, the `domains` table is of particular interest due to its direct relevance to the DNS enumeration feature.

### 1.2. Analysis of the `domains` Table

The `domains` table in `retrorecon` is defined as follows:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS domains (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    root_domain TEXT NOT NULL,
    subdomain TEXT NOT NULL,
    source TEXT NOT NULL,
    tags TEXT DEFAULT \'\',
    cdx_indexed INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    fetched_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    UNIQUE(subdomain, source)
);
```

This schema captures essential information for subdomain enumeration, including the `root_domain`, `subdomain`, and the `source` from which the subdomain was discovered (e.g., `crt.sh`, `virustotal.org`, `shodan.io`). The `tags` field allows for categorization, and `cdx_indexed` and `fetched_at` provide metadata about the data's origin and freshness. The `UNIQUE(subdomain, source)` constraint ensures that duplicate entries from the same source are not added.

### 1.3. Compatibility with User Requirements

#### 1.3.1. Spreadsheet-like Interface and Collapsible Rows

The existing `domains` table structure is well-suited for populating a spreadsheet-like interface. The `root_domain` and `subdomain` fields directly support the hierarchical display requested by the user:

```
- example.com
---- www.example.com
---- ---- stage.www.example.com
---- ---- dev.www.example.com
---- mail.example.com
```

To achieve the collapsible row functionality, the frontend application will need to process the `root_domain` and `subdomain` fields to construct a tree-like data structure. This can be done by parsing the `subdomain` field to identify sub-levels (e.g., `www.example.com` is a subdomain of `example.com`, and `stage.www.example.com` is a subdomain of `www.example.com`). The `id` field can serve as a unique identifier for each row, and the `tags` field can be used for filtering, sorting, labeling, and commenting, as requested by the user. Additional columns for user comments or labels can be added to the database schema if needed, or managed purely on the frontend.

#### 1.3.2. SQLite to PostgreSQL Transition

The `retrorecon` schema uses SQLite-specific syntax (e.g., `AUTOINCREMENT`). While the core table and column definitions are largely compatible, a direct migration to PostgreSQL will require minor adjustments. PostgreSQL uses `SERIAL` or `BIGSERIAL` for auto-incrementing primary keys, and `TEXT` types are generally compatible. The `TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` is also compatible. The `UNIQUE(subdomain, source)` constraint will also translate directly. Therefore, the transition from SQLite to PostgreSQL for this schema is straightforward and will primarily involve updating the data type for the `id` column and potentially adjusting any specific SQLite pragmas or functions if they were used in the original application's logic (which is not apparent from the schema alone).

#### 1.3.3. API Compatibility

The user expressed interest in reusing APIs from `retrorecon`. Given that `retrorecon` is a Python Flask application, its APIs would likely be RESTful endpoints. To ensure compatibility, the new React frontend will need to consume these APIs. The data returned by these APIs, particularly for subdomain enumeration, should align with the `domains` table structure. If the existing `retrorecon` APIs do not directly provide the normalized and deduplicated data in the desired format, a new backend service (or modifications to the existing `retrorecon` backend if it were to be reused) would be necessary to transform the data before sending it to the frontend. This new backend service would also handle the integration with `crt.sh`, `virustotal.org`, and `shodan.io` APIs, normalizing their outputs into the `domains` table format.

### 1.4. Recommendations for Subdomain Enumeration Services

In addition to `crt.sh`, `virustotal.org`, and `shodan.io`, other valuable services for subdomain enumeration include:

*   **Subfinder**: A passive subdomain enumeration tool that uses various sources.
*   **Amass**: A comprehensive attack surface mapping tool that includes subdomain enumeration.
*   **AssetFinder**: A tool to find domains and subdomains related to a given domain.
*   **DNSDumpster**: A web-based tool for DNS reconnaissance.

Integrating these services would further enhance the completeness of the subdomain enumeration. The backend service would be responsible for making API calls to these services, processing their responses, and inserting the unique subdomains into the `domains` table.




## 2. System Architecture and Technical Specifications

### 2.1. High-Level Architecture Overview

The proposed bug bounty reconnaissance application follows a modern three-tier architecture consisting of a React frontend, a Flask backend, and a database layer that starts with SQLite and migrates to PostgreSQL. The system is designed to be single-user and LAN-hosted for privacy, with integration to OpenAI-compatible LLM services through the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

The architecture can be visualized as follows:

```

### 2.2. Frontend Architecture

#### 2.2.1. React Application Structure

The React frontend will be built using Create React App with TypeScript for type safety and better development experience. The application will utilize a component-based architecture with the following key components:

**Main Layout Component**: This component will manage the split viewport layout, with the LLM chat interface on one side and the reconnaissance dashboard on the other. The layout will be responsive and allow users to resize the panels according to their preferences.

**Chat Interface Component**: This component will handle communication with the LLM through the backend API. It will maintain conversation history, support markdown rendering for LLM responses, and provide a clean, modern chat interface similar to those found in FANG company products.

**Reconnaissance Dashboard Component**: This is the core component that displays the spreadsheet-like interface for domain enumeration results. It will support collapsible rows, filtering, sorting, and inline editing for tags and comments.

**Domain Tree Component**: A specialized component for rendering the hierarchical domain structure with collapsible rows. This component will handle the tree-like data structure and provide intuitive expand/collapse functionality.

**API Integration Layer**: A service layer that handles all communication with the backend API, including domain enumeration requests, LLM chat messages, and data persistence operations.

#### 2.2.2. State Management

The application will use React Context API combined with useReducer hooks for state management. This approach provides a centralized state management solution without the complexity of external libraries like Redux. The state will be organized into several contexts:

**Domain Context**: Manages the state of domain enumeration data, including the tree structure, filtering options, and sorting preferences.

**Chat Context**: Handles the LLM conversation state, including message history and current conversation status.

**UI Context**: Manages UI-specific state such as panel sizes, theme preferences, and modal states.

#### 2.2.3. Styling and UI Framework

The application will use Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling, combined with Headless UI components for accessible, unstyled UI primitives. This combination allows for rapid development while maintaining design consistency and accessibility standards. The design will follow modern FANG-style principles with clean lines, subtle shadows, and a professional color palette.

### 2.3. Backend Architecture

The application will integrate with crt.sh's JSON API to discover subdomains through certificate transparency logs. The integration will handle rate limiting and response parsing.

```python
async def query_crt_sh(domain: str) -> List[str]:
    """Query crt.sh for subdomains of the given domain."""
    url = f"https://crt.sh/?q=%.{domain}&output=json"
    # Implementation details...
```

#### 2.5.2. VirusTotal API

Integration with VirusTotal's API will require API key management and proper rate limiting to comply with their usage policies.

```python
async def query_virustotal(domain: str, api_key: str) -> List[str]:
    """Query VirusTotal for subdomains of the given domain."""
    url = f"https://www.virustotal.com/vtapi/v2/domain/report"
    # Implementation details...
```

#### 2.5.3. Shodan API

Shodan integration will focus on discovering subdomains through their search API, with proper handling of search credits and rate limits.

## 6. Deployment Considerations and Infrastructure Requirements

### 6.1. Local Development Environment Setup

The development environment for this bug bounty reconnaissance application requires careful consideration of dependencies, external service integrations, and development workflow optimization. The local setup will be designed to minimize friction for developers while maintaining consistency with production environments.

The development stack will require Node.js for the React frontend development and Python for the Flask backend. Docker Compose will be used to orchestrate these services in development, ensuring that all developers work with identical service configurations and versions. The Docker setup will include hot reloading for both frontend and backend components to support rapid development iteration.

Database setup in development will use SQLite for simplicity and speed, with the option to use PostgreSQL in Docker containers when testing migration scenarios or PostgreSQL-specific features. The development database will be seeded with sample data to support testing and development of UI components without requiring actual enumeration operations.

External service integrations will be mocked in development environments to prevent unnecessary API calls and quota consumption during development. Mock services will provide realistic response data and support testing of error conditions and edge cases. Environment configuration will clearly distinguish between development, testing, and production modes to prevent accidental use of production API keys or services during development.

### 6.2. LAN Deployment Architecture

The LAN deployment scenario represents the primary target environment for this application, designed to support single-user operation within a private network environment. This deployment model prioritizes privacy and security while providing the performance and reliability needed for intensive reconnaissance operations.

The LAN deployment will utilize a single-server architecture where all components run on a dedicated machine within the user's private network. This approach eliminates external dependencies and ensures that sensitive reconnaissance data never leaves the user's controlled environment. The server will be configured with appropriate resource allocation for the expected workload, including sufficient memory for database operations and CPU capacity for concurrent enumeration tasks.

Network configuration for LAN deployment will include firewall rules that restrict access to the application to authorized IP addresses within the local network. The application will be configured to bind to specific network interfaces rather than all interfaces, providing an additional layer of security. HTTPS will be configured using self-signed certificates or internal certificate authority to ensure encrypted communication even within the private network.

Service management will be handled through systemd or similar service managers to ensure automatic startup and restart capabilities. The deployment will include monitoring and logging configuration to support troubleshooting and performance analysis. Backup strategies will be implemented for both application data and configuration to support disaster recovery scenarios.

### 6.3. Database Migration Strategy

The transition from SQLite to PostgreSQL represents a critical aspect of the deployment strategy, requiring careful planning to ensure data integrity and minimal downtime. The migration strategy will be designed to support both one-time migrations for new deployments and ongoing migrations for existing installations.

The migration process will begin with schema validation to ensure that the target PostgreSQL database is properly configured with all necessary tables, indexes, and constraints. Data migration will be performed using custom scripts that handle the differences between SQLite and PostgreSQL data types and constraints. The migration scripts will include comprehensive validation to ensure that all data is transferred correctly and completely.

Performance considerations for the migration include batch processing for large datasets and progress reporting to keep users informed about migration status. The migration process will be designed to be resumable in case of interruption, with checkpoint mechanisms that allow restarting from the last successful batch. Rollback procedures will be documented and tested to support recovery from failed migrations.

Post-migration validation will include comprehensive data integrity checks, performance testing, and functional testing to ensure that the application operates correctly with the new database backend. The migration process will be thoroughly documented with step-by-step instructions and troubleshooting guides to support users performing the migration.

### 6.4. Security Hardening and Access Control

Security hardening for the deployment environment will address multiple layers of the application stack, from the operating system level through the application layer. The hardening process will follow security best practices while maintaining the usability and functionality required for effective reconnaissance operations.

Operating system hardening will include disabling unnecessary services, configuring appropriate user accounts and permissions, and implementing host-based firewall rules. The application will run under a dedicated user account with minimal privileges, following the principle of least privilege. System updates and security patches will be managed through automated update mechanisms where appropriate.

Application-level security will include secure configuration of all components, proper handling of sensitive data such as API keys, and implementation of appropriate access controls. The Flask application will be configured with security headers, CSRF protection, and secure session management. Database access will be restricted through appropriate user accounts and connection security measures.

API key management will be implemented with encryption at rest and secure transmission protocols. The application will include mechanisms for key rotation and revocation to support ongoing security management. Audit logging will be implemented to track access to sensitive operations and data, providing accountability and supporting security incident investigation.

### 6.5. Monitoring and Maintenance Procedures

Comprehensive monitoring and maintenance procedures will be established to ensure reliable operation of the reconnaissance application in production environments. The monitoring strategy will address both technical performance metrics and business-level indicators of application health and effectiveness.

System monitoring will include resource utilization tracking for CPU, memory, disk space, and network usage. Application-specific monitoring will track API response times, job completion rates, error frequencies, and external service availability. The monitoring system will include alerting mechanisms for critical issues that require immediate attention.

Log management will be implemented with appropriate retention policies and analysis capabilities. Logs will be structured to support automated analysis and correlation across different application components. The logging system will include mechanisms for log rotation and archival to prevent disk space exhaustion while maintaining historical data for analysis.

Maintenance procedures will include regular database maintenance tasks such as index optimization and statistics updates. The application will include built-in maintenance tools for common operations such as data cleanup, cache management, and configuration validation. Backup procedures will be automated with regular testing to ensure data recovery capabilities.

Performance monitoring will track key metrics such as enumeration job completion times, database query performance, and user interface responsiveness. The monitoring system will include trending analysis to identify performance degradation over time and support capacity planning decisions.

### 6.6. Scalability and Resource Planning

While the application is designed for single-user operation, scalability considerations are important for handling large-scale enumeration operations and growing datasets. The architecture will be designed to scale vertically within the constraints of a single-server deployment while maintaining performance and reliability.

Resource planning will consider the expected workload characteristics including the number of domains under analysis, the frequency of enumeration operations, and the volume of data generated over time. The planning process will include analysis of different usage patterns and their impact on system resources to support appropriate hardware selection and configuration.

Database scalability will be addressed through appropriate indexing strategies, query optimization, and data archival procedures. The application will include mechanisms for managing large datasets efficiently, including pagination, filtering, and data compression where appropriate. Database maintenance procedures will be designed to scale with data volume while minimizing impact on application availability.

Background job processing scalability will be achieved through appropriate thread management and asyncio configuration. The native Python threading/asyncio-based job system will be configured to handle varying workloads efficiently while preventing resource exhaustion.
