## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by our Code of Conduct. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

### Branch Naming

- `feature/description` - for new features
- `bugfix/description` - for bug fixes
- `hotfix/description` - for urgent fixes
- `docs/description` - for documentation updates

### Commit Messages

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

Examples:
```
feat(auth): add two-factor authentication
fix(api): resolve domain enumeration timeout
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

## Code Style

### Python (Backend)

- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use Black for code formatting
- Use Flake8 for linting
- Maximum line length: 88 characters
- Use type hints where appropriate

#### Code Formatting
```bash
# Format code
black app/ tests/

# Check formatting
black --check app/ tests/

# Lint code
flake8 app/ tests/
```

### TypeScript/React (Frontend)

- Follow ESLint configuration
- Use Prettier for code formatting
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow React best practices

#### Code Formatting
```bash
cd frontend

# Format code
npm run format

# Lint code
npm run lint

# Fix linting issues
npm run lint:fix
```

### General Guidelines

- Write clear, readable code
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use descriptive variable names
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase

## Testing

```

### Frontend Tests

```bash
cd frontend

# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test file
